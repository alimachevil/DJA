🎧 DJ-A (With Gesture Control) 🎶
Would you like to control your favorite music without a keyboard or buttons, like a futuristic DJ? 🕶️🎛️ Well...U can do it now! This gesture detection project converts your hands into multimedia controllers that let you change the song and adjust the volume. All without touching any device! 👀

🖐️ What does this project do? 
With the help of MediaPipe and OpenCV, this program detects the movements of your hands to realize actions like:

Next song 👉: Slide three fingers (Index, middle, and ring fingers) to the right.
Previous song 👈: Slide those three same fingers to the left. 
Turn it up some more 🔊: Raise both hands.
Make it lower 🔉: Put both hands down.

Full air control! 🎐

🛠️ Tech Used
MediaPipe: For hand tracking and gesture detection. 
OpenCV: For camera real-time processing.  
PyAutoGUI: For control of the multimedia Windows keys.

⚡ How can I start?
Clone this repository.
Install these dependencies:
*pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui* 
¡Connect with your music! 🎶
*python dj_gesture_control.py*

And now, move your hands like a DJ! 🔥

🤖 Type of uses 
If only one hand is detected, you can change your songs by sliding your three fingers to the right or the left.
In the case of two hands, you can adjust the volume by raising or putting down them.

Perfect for improvised parties! 🎶

⚠️ WARNINGS!
This a beta. It was like a flash thought that I turned into reality in an hour. The idea is to improve this project over time with more types of uses or functionalities. 

📷 What do you need?
A web camera (preferentially HD) to track your gestures in real time.
And OBVIOUSLY, a music of good taste! 😋🎧🎉
